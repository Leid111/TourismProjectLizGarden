Tourism page for Hunter Valley Gardens

This repo stores my efforts to create a toursims page dedicated to the beautiful gardens of Hunter Valley. I hope you enjoy :)

The coding process:

Overall an enjoyable experience. I focused on getting the MVP down before exploring other features (though I did get side tracked here at some points). I used google throughout the process. This includes finding resources on how to embed a map and the hover/text appear feature on the gallery page ( which i am particularly excited about). Given the relatively small scope of my webpage, I used one partial to store my variables and mixins. The form submission is linked to formspree account i created - so have a go at submitting a form ( it should work!).
